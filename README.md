### Plugins I wrote

#### [Yahoo Stock Ticker](https://getbitbar.com/plugins/Finance/yahoo_stock_ticker.10m.py)

Dependencies: Python3 (there is also a version of this in [Bash](https://github.com/longpdo/bitbar-plugins-custom/blob/master/deactivated-plugins/yahoo-stock-ticker.5m.sh), but without the price alarm functionality)

* Pulls stock information from the Yahoo Finance API v7
* Shows major stock indices in the menu bar
* Shows stock symbols in the dropdown menu with additional information in the submenus
* Orders stock symbols by user configuration (alphabetically, market change by value ascending or descending or by absolute value)

[![Yahoo Stock Ticker Screenshot 1][yahoo-stock-ticker]](https://github.com/longpdo/bitbar-plugins-custom/blob/master/plugins/yahoo_stock_ticker.18m.py)

* Remove one of your price limits by clicking on it
